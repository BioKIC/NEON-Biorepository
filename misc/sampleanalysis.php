				<h1>Sample Analysis</h1>
				<h2>NEON Biorepository Sample API</h2>
				
				<p>The NEON Biorepository Sample API provides programmatic access to data about our collections, samples, and taxonomy. This API allows users to construct URLs or cURL statements to retrieve information in <a href="https://json.org/json-en.html">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</a> format.</p>
				
				<p>To explore available endpoints and try them out directly, use the API Explorer:</p>
				
				<p>
				  <button type="button" class="button" onclick="window.location.href='<?php echo $CLIENT_ROOT; ?>/api/v2/documentation'">
					Open Biorepository API Explorer
				  </button>
				</p>

				<h2>Sample Explorer</h2>
				<p>NEON collects and archives up to 120,000 samples per year at the NEON Biorepository. Additional samples are collected for destructive analysis at the NEON Domain Support Facilities or external laboratories. To track samples moving between facilities, NEON generates shipment manifests and standardized receipt forms that enable NEON to track the location of a sample through its lifetime from generation in the field to final disposition. Because of the use of barcodes and autogenerated shipment manifests, NEON has greatly reduced the opportunity for transcription errors associated with labels and sample transfer. A sample's custody and location history, as well as relationships to other samples (parent, child, and siblings) can be explored using the <a href="https://data.neonscience.org/sample-explorer">Sample Explorer</a>. At the Biorepository, samples are curated following best museum practices to ensure findability within the collections.</p>

				<figcaption style="background: #F5F6F7; font-size: 15px;">Sample search results for ABBY.20170420.R0188.E; this is a mammal ear punch sample that was collected at ABBY, brought to the domain facility D16 and then shipped to CCDB for pathogen testing.</figcaption>
				<p>The NEON Sample Explorer also allows users to explore the relationship between a sample from the field and all downstream subsamples and mixtures. For example, a female Peromyscus leucopus (NEON.MAM.D01.L0253) was captured at the HARV site in 2013 on multiple dates. Using this tool, a user can see all subsamples from this mammal â€“ in this case 3 fecal samples, 2 blood samples, 2 hair samples, and 1 ear tissue collection.</p>
